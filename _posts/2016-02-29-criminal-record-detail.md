## Sample Criminal File Search Report

These reports are to be used as tools to help our users evaluate a relationship. The founders of U. S. Criminal Records Agency have a passion for providing this service because the 16-year old daughter of a friend was murdered after a careless and uninformed adult relationship was undertaken by her mother. Had she run a 15-second background check she would have learned that the killer had 19 criminal charges filed against him during the previous 6 years.

Because some information may not be available or be 100% accurate or complete, extreme caution should be exercised. Data available varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Reports in some jurisdictions are limited to felons who have been imprisoned. Convictions not leading to imprisonment are not available in those jurisdictions. Also, numerous states do not make criminal records available to the public, including information about registered sex offenders. We provide the largest source of criminal files on the Internet, but information is limited to those jurisdictions that permit public access.
