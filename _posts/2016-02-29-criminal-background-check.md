## CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK

US Criminal Records Agency provides instant criminal background checks from databases of criminal files covering most U.S. states and some U.S. counties.  Please check the list before entering your credit card information to see that your state of interest is listed.  Before conducting a search, please also see [Sample Report][0], [Report Description][1], and [Refund Policy][2]

Each database contains felony convictions. Some databases contain misdemeanor dispositions and/or traffic violations. Databases vary as to the beginning date of the data contained therein: some date back several decades; others date back to the early 1990s. In general, criminal background check results from these databases show name, date of birth, race, sex, offense, disposition, date of disposition, county and case number.  Criminal records that are open to the public are limited in some jurisdictions to felons who have been imprisoned.  Because mistakes may occur when trying to investigate a particular person based solely upon name and other identifiers, we require the date of birth of the person whose record you are searching.  
Listed below are the states where US Criminal Records Agency criminal background checks are available. See Criminal Records Descriptions below. We report only what is made available by each jurisdiction.  These databases are updated regularly from public records acquired from government agencies.
